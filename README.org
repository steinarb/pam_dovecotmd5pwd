* A PAM module that updates the dovecot cram-md5 password file
** Introduction

This PAM module hooks into password changes, and updates the cram-md5
file, used by the dovecot IMAP deamon, for cram-md5 authentication,
when PAM is used to change a user's password.

This PAM module has only been tested out in debian Wheezy (this just
because stable, at the time of writing).


** Installation

To build the module, type:
: make

To install the module, as root, either do:
: make install
or, after building, simply do:
: cp pam_dovecotmd5pwd.so /lib/security/

The final part is to add the new module to the
=/etc/pam.d/common-password= file.  Add the following line in a
suitable place:
: password	required			pam_dovecotmd5pwd.so

I'm not entirely sure of where in the file to put it, but the comments
in =/etc/pam.d/common-password= say:
#+begin_example
  # As of pam 1.0.1-6, this file is managed by pam-auth-update by default.
  # To take advantage of this, it is recommended that you configure any
  # local modules either before or after the default block, and use
  # pam-auth-update to manage selection of other modules.  See
  # pam-auth-update(8) for details.
#+end_example

From that comment, what I've done is put the config for the new
module, after the line
: # end of pam-auth-update config

I.e. like so:
#+begin_example
  ...
  # end of pam-auth-update config
  
  # Update cram-md5 passwords for dovecot
  password        required                        pam_dovecotmd5pwd.so
#+end_example


** TODO-list
 - Read the cram-md5 password list from the dovecot configuration
 - Use the same library as "doveadm pw" to create the hashed password,
   instead of starting a subprocess
