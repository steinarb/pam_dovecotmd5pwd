* A PAM module that updates the dovecot cram-md5 password file
** Introduction

This PAM module hooks into password changes, and updates the cram-md5
file, used by the dovecot IMAP deamon, for cram-md5 authentication,
when PAM is used to change a user's password.

** Installation

To build the module, type:
: make

To install the module, as root, either do:
: make install
or, after building, simply do:
: cp pam_dovecotmd5pwd.so /lib/security/

** TODO-list
 - Read the cram-md5 password list from the dovecot configuration
 - Use the same library as "doveadm pw" to create the hashed password,
   instead of starting a subprocess
